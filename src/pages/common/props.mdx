# Props

## Overview

```jsx
useSpring({ from: { ... }, to: { ... }, delay: 100, onRest: () => ... })
```

All primitives inherit the following properties (though some of them may bring their own additionally):

| Property           | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| delay              | number/fn         | Delay in ms before the animation starts. Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => delay                                                                      |
| immediate          | bool/fn           | Prevents animation if true. Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => immediate                                                                               |
| [config](#configs) | obj/fn            | Spring config (contains mass, tension, friction, etc). Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => config                                                       |
| reset              | bool              | The spring starts to animate from scratch (from -> to) if set true                                                                                                       |
| reverse            | bool              | "from" and "to" are switched if set true, this will only make sense in combination with the "reset" flag                                                                 |
| cancel             | bool/string/fn    | When `true`, the `cancel` prop stops the animation of every animated value owned by the `Controller` that receives it. See [cancel prop](/#cancel-prop) for more details |
| pause              | bool              | The `pause` prop literally freezes animations in time.                                                                                                                   |

## Advanced Props

### Loop Prop

### Cancel Prop

When `true`, the `cancel` prop stops the animation of every animated value
owned by the `Controller` that receives it.

The following example never animates, because `cancel` is always true.

```js
useSpring({
  cancel: true,
  from: { x: 0 },
  to: { x: 100 },
})
```

Once the `cancel` prop turns from `true` to `false`, the declared animation
will resume or reset, depending on the given props.

#### Delayed updates

The `cancel` prop even prevents delayed updates. ðŸ˜Ž

```jsx
const [style, animate] = useSpring(() => ({ x: 0 }))

// Pass this to an element.
const onClick = () => {
  animate({ x: 100, delay: 500 })

  // Prevent the previous update. ðŸ¤£
  animate({ cancel: true })
}
```

#### Specific keys

To cancel the animation of specific keys, you can pass a single key, an array of
keys, or a `(key: string) => boolean` function.

```js
// Using a single key
cancel: 'x',

// Using an array of keys
cancel: ['x', 'y'],

// Using a function
cancel: key => key !== 'x',
```

The `reset` and `immediate` props support these same types.

### Events

Events are great. thanks
