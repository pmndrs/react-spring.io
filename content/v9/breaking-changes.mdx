title: Breaking Changes
---

This page is all about breaking changes between v8.x and v9.x. Get ready to upgrade!

# The `useTransition` hook

The new `useTransition` is used like this:

```js
// 1. Provide items and props
const transition = useTransition(items, props)
// 2. Map the items into a fragment
const fragment = transition((style, item) => {
  // 3. Render each item
  return <a.div style={style}>{item}</a.div>
})
```

### The `transition` function

On this page, the `transition` function returned by `useTransition` is
referred to as the `TransitionFn` (its type name in TypeScript).

It accepts a callback that receives four arguments: the animated values,
the item, the `Transition` object, and the sibling position.

It returns a React fragment containing every element returned by your
callback. As you might assume, elements in the middle of their `leave`
animation need to remain mounted.

All elements in the fragment are guaranteed to have a `key` prop, whether or
not you define one explicitly. Unkeyed elements will use the `ctrl.id` from
their `Transition` object.

### Transition objects

For every unique item key, there exists a `Transition` object. The only time
you have access to a `Transition` object is when it's passed as the 3rd argument
of your `TransitionFn` callback.

```js
// The `t` argument is a Transition object.
// The `i` argument is the sibling position.
const elems = transition((style, item, t, i) => (
  <a.div style={style}>{t.phase}</a.div>
))
```

### Transition keys

Every `Transition` object has a unique key that identifies it. You have the
option of defining explicit keys or letting the "item" (the value represented
by the `Transition` object) be its own key.

To define explicit keys, you must define the `keys` prop in your `useTransition`
props. For example, when using an items array, the new `keys` prop can be:

- an array of keys
- or a mapping function that returns a key for any item given to it.

```js
useTransition(items, {
  // Using a function
  keys: item => item.key,
  // Using an array created by lodash.map
  keys: _.map(items, 'key'),
})
```

⚠️ You **must** use explicit keys for any item that is an immutable object.

Using explicit keys for mutable objects is unnecessary. 🥳

### The `key` prop

If you're passing a single item to `useTransition`, you have the option of
passing a single key as the `key` prop.

```js
useTransition(item, {
  key: item.key,
})
```

### The `expires` prop

The `expires` prop lets you control when removed items are unmounted (after
their `leave` animation has finished). By default, unmounting is postponed
until the next render or until all transitions are resting.

When `true` or `<= 0`, the default behavior is used.

When `false`, items are never unmounted.

When `> 0`, this prop is used in a `setTimeout` call that forces a
rerender if the component that called `useTransition` doesn't rerender
on its own after an item's `leave` animation is finished.

Finally, the `expires` prop can be a function that receives an item and returns any of
the values mentioned above.

### The `ref` prop

Pass a ref as the `ref` prop for access to the ref API.

```jsx
const ref = useRef()
useTransition(items, {
  ref,
  from: { opacity: 0 },
  enter: { opacity: 1 },
  leave: { opacity: 0 },
})
useEffect(() => {
  ref.current.start()
})
```

The `TransitionHandle` object in `ref.current` has an almost identical
API to what `useSprings` has.

### Other changes

Here are the breaking changes in `useTransition` without their own section.

- The `reset` prop now prefers the `initial` prop over the `from` prop.

- The `unique` prop was removed.
  Unique mode is now the default behavior.

- The `lazy` prop was removed (in favor of the `expires` prop).
  Lazy mode is now the default behavior.

- The `onDestroyed` prop was removed.

- The `order` prop was removed.

---

# The `onFrame` prop

This prop has been renamed to `onChange`, because it's _not_ necessarily called
from within a `requestAnimationFrame` callback.

For example, the `onChange` prop is called when you call the `set` method of an
animated value.

---

# The `from` prop

The `from` prop behaves differently in imperative updates. When defined,
it implies the `reset` prop is true. Previously, the `from` prop would
not affect the animation unless `reset: true` was explicitly defined.

```js react-live=true
const { x } = useSpring({ x: 0 })
useEffect(() => {
  // This animates as expected, from 100 to 0.
  x.start({ from: 100, to: 0 })
})
```

The example above uses the new `SpringValue` API.

---

# The `interpolate` function

This function is now the `to` function.

```jsx
import { to } from 'react-spring'

const { x, y } = useSpring({
  from: { x: 0, y: 0 },
})

// Combine two animated values
to([x, y], (x, y) => x / y)
```

---

# Globals API

Global configuration has been improved.

```js
import { colorNames, createStringInterpolator } from './globals'

// v8
import * as Globals from 'react-spring/animated/Globals'
Globals.injectDefaultElement('div')
Globals.injectStringInterpolator(createStringInterpolator)
Globals.injectColorNames(colorNames)

// v9
import { Globals } from 'react-spring'
Globals.assign({
  defaultElement: 'div',
  createStringInterpolator,
  colorNames,
})
```

---

# The `Controller` class

Unless you've been using `new Controller()` or have been accessing the `controllers`
property off the ref API, these changes won't affect you.

- The `interpolate` method is now the `to` method.

- The `stop` method no longer has an optional `finished` argument.
  Instead, it accepts zero or more keys to specifically stop animating.

- The `pause` method was removed. This method will be restored once the pausing
  feature is ready.

- The `destroy` method was renamed to `dispose`.

- Most properties have been either renamed or removed.
